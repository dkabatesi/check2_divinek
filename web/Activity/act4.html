<p>The first paragraph will introduce your topic. The introduction is the most important paragraph because it provides direction for the entire essay. It also sets the tone, and you want to grab the reader's attention with interest and clarity. ... Describe your main idea, or what the essay is about, in one sentence.</p>

While we enjoyed our picnic lunch under a tree, a small gray squirrel crawled close to us. Suddenly this squirrel grabbed my delicious piece of pie off my plate and scurried off.</p>
